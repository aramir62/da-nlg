my  opinion is that Little Nightmares good adventure, platformer, puzzle side view
Adventure games that combine platforming and puzzles can be frustrating to play, but the side view perspective is perfect for them. That's why I enjoyed playing Little Nightmares.

my  opinion is that BioShock M (for Mature) good Steam
BioShock is a solid M rated game available on both Steam and Linux.

my  opinion is that Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne poor role-playing, turn-based strategy
Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne is an all around poor example of a turn-based strategy RPG game.

my  opinion is that Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings T (for Teen) good multiplayer
I have fun playing Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. I like that it has a multiplayer and, since it's only rated T (for Teen), I'm able to play it with friends and younger siblings.

my  opinion is that World of Warcraft Blizzard Entertainment good
World of Warcraft is a fun game. Blizzard Entertainment is a developer that knows what they're doing and always produces a solid product.
